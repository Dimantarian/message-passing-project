api-location-create endpoint documentation

Post requests can be made to this endpoint that conform to the following schema:

```
message Location {
    int64 person_id = 1;
    string longitude = 2;
    string latitude = 3;
}
```

An example microservice (location-producer) has been setup to generate a new location event for each person.
This can be deployed by running the following, once all other services are live:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment/udaconnect-location-producer.yaml
```
